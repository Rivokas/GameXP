            <p><em>World of Warcraft</em> (WoW) is the pinnacle of MMORPGs, an expansive and immersive online world that has captivated players since its launch in 2004. Developed by Blizzard Entertainment, this game has continuously evolved through its numerous expansions, offering new lands, stories, and challenges that keep players engaged for years.</p>

            <p><strong>Core Gameplay</strong><br>
            WoW combines deep lore, thrilling combat, and intricate character progression. Players choose from various races and classes, each with unique abilities and lore-rich backgrounds. The game world, Azeroth, is filled with quests, dungeons, raids, battlegrounds, and endless opportunities for exploration and adventure.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Expansions and Evolution</strong><br>
            Over the years, WoW has expanded with multiple expansions, each bringing fresh content, improved mechanics, and refined storytelling. These expansions introduced new continents, enhanced gameplay systems, and innovative features that reshaped the game. From the chilling menace of the Lich King to the cosmic battles against the Burning Legion, every expansion has left a significant mark on WoW's legacy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Graphics & World Design</strong><br>
            While WoW's graphics have aged since its original release, Blizzard has continuously updated textures, animations, and environments to keep the game visually appealing. The world design remains one of its strongest aspects, featuring breathtaking landscapes, dynamic cities, and a sense of scale that immerses players in its fantasy setting.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Audio & Music</strong><br>
            The game's soundtrack is legendary, with sweeping orchestral scores that enhance the epic feel of the world. Iconic themes accompany players through their journey, and voice acting has improved significantly over the years, making story-driven content more engaging.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Community & Replayability</strong><br>
            One of WoW’s greatest strengths is its community. From guilds and PvP arenas to role-playing and cooperative raids, the social aspect is a core reason why players return. Whether grinding for achievements, diving into dungeons, or engaging in large-scale PvP battles, there is always something to do.</p>

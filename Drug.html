Developed by Byterunners Game Studio and published by Movie Games S.A., this title offers an immersive and surprisingly deep experience.</p>

     <p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>
     The game combines open-world exploration, strategic business management, and stealth elements.

The mechanics of mixing and cutting substances, negotiating deals, and expanding operations add layers of realism and strategy.</p>

     <p><strong>Graphics and Atmosphere</strong><br>

     <p><strong>Challenges and Progression</strong><br>
     As players advance, they face greater risks, including aggressive police patrols, rival dealers, and financial challenges. Managing reputation and keeping a low profile becomes increasingly important. The game does a great job of balancing risk and reward, keeping players engaged.</p>

     <p><strong>Verdict</strong><br>
     Drug Dealer Simulator is an engaging and well-designed game for those who enjoy crime-themed simulations. It offers an addictive progression system, intense moments of evasion, and a surprisingly detailed economic system. While the graphics could use some improvement, the overall gameplay experience makes up for it. If you're looking for a unique simulator with a darker twist, this game is worth checking out.</p>
